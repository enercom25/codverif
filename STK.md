1. STK for SCOS-2000 (https://issues.cosmos.esa.int/solarorbiterwiki/download/attachments/23757668/MOC-applicable%20MIB%20egos-mcs-s2k-icd-0001-version7.0-FINAL.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1522940882000&api=v2) is a data definition standard used to define the structure of packets that are used to invoke standardized services defined in the packet utilization standard (PUS: https://ecss.nl/standard/ecss-e-st-70-41c-space-engineering-telemetry-and-telecommand-packet-utilization-15-april-2016/). 

2. PUS is a service oriented architecture. It defines a list of 19 standardized services which aim to command and control cyber physical systems. SCOS-2000 defines all necessary constraints that data used to invoke PUS services has to uphold. These constraints are summarized in the attached STK ICD document (https://issues.cosmos.esa.int/solarorbiterwiki/download/attachments/23757668/MOC-applicable%20MIB%20egos-mcs-s2k-icd-0001-version7.0-FINAL.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1522940882000&api=v2).

3. All packets used to invoke PUS services are generally defined in a reference database
